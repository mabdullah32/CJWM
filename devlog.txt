INITIAL DD REVIEW -- 2025-10-23 21:00
  - A site map is quite necessary for our next design document so we can know how each page relates to each other
  - Should include more fleshed-out descriptions of how login/logout should be implemented
  - cant store data in lists for tables: should aim to use a different data storing system with SQLite

[Design Doc Changes]
  - Split up the python implementation of the blog components into different files
  - __init__.py : app setup, create flask app, configure settings,
  - data.py : handle data, define tables, handle database
  - routes.py : app logic, connect front-end with back-end, handle user actions,                       define all urls
  - helpers.py : support functions for authentication, etc.
  - to-do: create new component map with new python files
