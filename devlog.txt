INITIAL DD REVIEW -- 2025-10-23 21:00
  - A site map is quite necessary for our next design document so we can know how each page relates to each other
  - Should include more fleshed-out descriptions of how login/logout should be implemented

[Design Doc Changes]
  - Split up the python implementation of the blog components into different files
  - __init__.py : app setup, create flask app, configure settings,
