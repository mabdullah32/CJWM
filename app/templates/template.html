          Astonishment radio telescope billions upon billions rogue cosmic fugue dream of the mind's eye.
          Tendrils of gossamer clouds citizens of distant epochs permanence of the stars the sky calls to us
          paroxysm of global death Tunguska event. Vanquish the impossible encyclopaedia galactica
          dispassionate extraterrestrial observer a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena with pretty stories
          for which there's little good evidence tesseract? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
          dispassionate extraterrestrial observer the carbon in our apple pies courage of our questions how far
          away two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing and billions upon billions
          upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.

          Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone
          Family wants to buy you out. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. If anything in this life is
          certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. What's the matter with you?
          Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I
          do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!

          My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends
          close, but your enemies closer. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take
          sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I see you took the name of the town. What was your
          father's name? You can act like a man! Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! We're both
          part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Don't you know that I
          would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? You talk about vengeance. Is
          vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and
          I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his
          bread in his hands, alright?
